# Twitter Monitor

Twitter monitor allows users to filter Twitter messages based on their personal interests. The intelligent web application continuously listens to the Twitter stream and stores the relevant tweets into a database. The user enters "key words" that describe topics s/he is interested in. Our algorithm calculates, based on the user input, a rating for each tweet which then get potentially displayed in the user interface. Following that, users have the opportunity to evaluate the displayed tweets providing a feedback mechanism for the algorithm by choosing the most interesting tweets for users. The applications also offers many different settings such as e-mail notification, topic categories or a blacklist for topics that are not relevant to the users.
