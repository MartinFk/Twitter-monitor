# Twitter Monitor


Twitter-Monitor allows users to filter twitter messages based on their personal interests. The intelligent web application continuously listens to the Twitter stream and stores the relevant tweets into a database. The user enters “key words” that describe topics s/he is interested in. Our algorithm uses these key words to calculate the importance of the tweet which then get displayed in the user preferred order. The program also offers many different settings such as e-mail notification, topic categories or a blacklist for topics that are not relevant to the user. The interface is accessible from various platforms, and is not directly connected to a device which makes it more flexible.
